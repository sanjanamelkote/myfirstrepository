Things I like to do in Berkeley: 

* Stay safe during quarantine
* Cook tasty meals
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

My plans for the weekend are: 

1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class.
2. Double-check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments.
3. Triple-check that all assignemnts are done.
